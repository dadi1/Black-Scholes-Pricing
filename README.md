# Black-Scholes-Pricing
Small Python Library Project Implemented in C++ to be use in Python for pricing Option using Black-Scholes Method.

## Python Library Project:
This Project was inspired for Roland Korbeles`s book on Mathematical Physics applied on Finance[1] and the code in the book can be seen [here](base-code/basecode.m). Also some part of the Code was inspiring in Mark S. Joshi Book. 
The main purpose of this project is to help me learn how to implemented a code in C++ and make Python compatible and for this project I use Ctypes[3].
 I have plans to improve this librayr in the future when I have time.

### To do list
- [ ] Add defense programming.
- [ ] Numpy/Pandas compabillity.
